        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
        1. TIME WINDOW FLEXIBILITY: Each visit has a time window (e.g., 7:00-8:00 AM) and a duration (e.g., 30 mins)
           - The visit can START anytime within the window
           - The visit must FINISH before the window closes
           - Example: 7:00-8:00 AM window with 30-min duration = can start between 7:00-7:30 AM
           - This flexibility allows for optimal routing and scheduling
        2. MULTIPLE VISITS with overlapping time windows must be sequenced - they cannot happen simultaneously
        3. Account for realistic travel time between locations. For Austin, TX traffic: locations within 5 miles estimate 10-15 minutes; locations 5-10 miles estimate 15-20 minutes; locations further apart estimate proportionally.
        4. When visits share the same time window, sequence them optimally considering:
           - Travel distance between locations
           - Service duration for each visit
           - Buffer time for travel within the shared window
           - Use the time window flexibility to fit both visits optimally
        5. Minimize total travel distance and time across the entire day
        6. Consider the service duration for each visit
        7. If HOME BASE is provided, start from that location. If HOME BASE is 'Not provided', assume the starting point for optimization is the location of the first scheduled visit in the optimized route.
        8. If it is impossible to create a feasible route that accommodates all visits within their specified time windows, provide an 'optimizedOrder' array that includes only the visits that can be completed. Include a 'feasibleRoute' boolean flag set to 'false' in the JSON output. In the 'reasoning', clearly state which visits could not be fit into the schedule and why.
        
        ROUTE EFFICIENCY RULES:
        ‚úÖ START at home base (if provided) or first visit location
        ‚úÖ Go DIRECTLY from visit to visit for maximum efficiency
        ‚ùå DO NOT return to home base after each visit
        ‚úÖ When time windows overlap, choose the CLOSEST next visit
        ‚úÖ Only return to home base at the END of the route (or during long breaks)
        ‚úÖ Optimize the path like a delivery driver - minimize backtracking
        ‚úÖ Use time window flexibility to optimize route efficiency
        
        EXAMPLE 1: Single visit flexibility
        - Time window: 7:00-8:00 AM, Duration: 30 minutes
        - Can start anytime between 7:00-7:30 AM (must finish by 8:00 AM)
        - Flexible start times: 7:00 AM, 7:15 AM, 7:30 AM, etc.
        
        EXAMPLE 2: Two 30-minute visits both in 7:00-8:00 AM window:
        - With 10-minute travel time between visits
        - Option A: Visit A 7:00-7:30, Travel 7:30-7:40, Visit B 7:40-8:10 (INVALID - B exceeds window)
        - Option B: Visit A 7:00-7:20, Travel 7:20-7:30, Visit B 7:30-8:00 (VALID - both fit in window)
        - Option C: Recognize if window is too tight, recommend scheduling in different windows
        
        KEY INSIGHT: Use time window flexibility to optimize routes and fit multiple visits efficiently!

        Where:
        - optimizedOrder: Array of visit numbers in the optimal order
        - estimatedTotalDistance: Total driving distance in miles
        - estimatedTotalTime: Total time elapsed from the start of the first visit until the end of the last visit, including both travel time between visits and the duration of each visit (in minutes)
        - efficiency: Efficiency score from 1-100. A score of 100 indicates the most optimal route possible with minimal wasted time/distance and successful accommodation of all visits within their time windows. Lower scores indicate more travel or difficulty fitting visits.
        - feasibleRoute: Boolean indicating if all visits can be accommodated within their time windows (true) or if some visits had to be excluded (false)
        - reasoning: Brief explanation of why this order is optimal, especially how overlapping windows were sequenced. If feasibleRoute is false, clearly state which visits could not be fit and why.
