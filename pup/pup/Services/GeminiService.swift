        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
        1. TIME WINDOW FLEXIBILITY: Each visit has a time window (e.g., 7:00-8:00 AM) and a duration (e.g., 30 mins)
           - The visit can START anytime within the window
           - The visit must FINISH before the window closes
           - Example: 7:00-8:00 AM window with 30-min duration = can start between 7:00-7:30 AM
           - This flexibility allows for optimal routing and scheduling
        2. MULTIPLE VISITS with overlapping time windows must be sequenced - they cannot happen simultaneously
        3. Account for realistic travel time between locations (assume Austin, TX traffic - typically 10-20 minutes between locations)
        4. When visits share the same time window, sequence them optimally considering:
           - Travel distance between locations
           - Service duration for each visit
           - Buffer time for travel within the shared window
           - Use the time window flexibility to fit both visits optimally
        5. Minimize total travel distance and time across the entire day
        6. Consider the service duration for each visit
        7. Start from the home base if provided
        
        ROUTE EFFICIENCY RULES:
        ‚úÖ START at home base (if provided)
        ‚úÖ Go DIRECTLY from visit to visit for maximum efficiency
        ‚ùå DO NOT return to home base after each visit
        ‚úÖ When time windows overlap, choose the CLOSEST next visit
        ‚úÖ Only return to home base at the END of the route (or during long breaks)
        ‚úÖ Optimize the path like a delivery driver - minimize backtracking
        ‚úÖ Use time window flexibility to optimize route efficiency
        
        EXAMPLE 1: Single visit flexibility
        - Time window: 7:00-8:00 AM, Duration: 30 minutes
        - Can start anytime between 7:00-7:30 AM (must finish by 8:00 AM)
        - Flexible start times: 7:00 AM, 7:15 AM, 7:30 AM, etc.
        
        EXAMPLE 2: Two 30-minute visits both in 7:00-8:00 AM window:
        - With 10-minute travel time between visits
        - Option A: Visit A 7:00-7:30, Travel 7:30-7:40, Visit B 7:40-8:10 (INVALID - B exceeds window)
        - Option B: Visit A 7:00-7:20, Travel 7:20-7:30, Visit B 7:30-8:00 (VALID - both fit in window)
        - Option C: Recognize if window is too tight, recommend scheduling in different windows
        
        KEY INSIGHT: Use time window flexibility to optimize routes and fit multiple visits efficiently!
